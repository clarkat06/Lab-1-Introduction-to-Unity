## Fishy Business

The goal of this game is to remove rotten fish from the conveyor and allow fresh fish to be transported to the furnace for cooking. Removing  a fresh fish or allowing a rotten fish to reach the furnace will decrease the player's money by 5-15$. Once a fresh fish reaches the furnace, the player gains 5-15$. 

Narrative: In this world, the player runs a factory responsible for cooking fish at an industrial level. Removing fresh fish and/or failing to remove rotten fish results in a decrease in profit.

Mechanics: Mouse input results in the removal of fish from the conveyor.

## Fishy Business

The goal of this game is to remove rotten fish from the conveyor and allow fresh fish to be transported to the furnace for cooking. Removing  a fresh fish or allowing a rotten fish to reach the furnace will decrease the player's money by 5-15$. Once a fresh fish reaches the furnace, the player gains 5-15$. 

Narrative: In this world, the player runs a factory responsible for cooking fish at an industrial level. Removing fresh fish and/or failing to remove rotten fish results in a decrease in profit.

Mechanics: Mouse input results in the removal of fish from the conveyor. 

Aesthetics: Background and sprites are all pixel art, with a text counter for cash in the top-right.

Joys and Struggles: The actual game itself came together quite smoothly, which is always nice. However, we did run into some trouble when it came to pulling the project from GitHub, although we eventually figured it out. Creating a particle system was also a little annoying, but we figured that out as well.

Contributions: Ian and Andrew both collaborated on the programming of the game itself; Ian wrote the code while Andrew researched the appropriate components/objects needed to make the game happen. Once the programming was finished, Andrew found some background assets and made some sprites on his own to add into the game.
